He thrives in async and remote environments, works well independently, and consistently makes smart decisions about where to invest his time and energy.\n\nHe's a strong contributor you can trust to do great work with minimal supervision and make the whole team better in the process.

He asks questions when things aren't clear, and gets creative when he meets roadblocks. He handled the encryption code on our web app, some of the more arcane parts of our architecture, even as a newer engineer at the time.
